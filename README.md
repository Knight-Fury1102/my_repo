Learning to use git 

- git clone <-some link-> -> clones the repository or whatever link from github to the current working directory.
- git status -> used to track the status of the files i.e whether they are the same as the github file or not.
- - Untracked - new files that git does not track yet.
- - modified - changes have occured.
- - staged - file is ready to be committed.
- - unmodified - unchanged.
- git add <-file name-> -> adds untracked or modified files in working directory to Git staging area
- git commit -m "some message" -> is the record of change
